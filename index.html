            <h5>Update 9th March</h5>
            <hr>
            <div class="alert alert-danger">
                Whilst rather detailed, this update is the most significant to date. <b>Please ensure you read in full.</b> <br>
            </div>
            
            <hr>
            Today I received the final cost of the community fibre infrastructure build, to all 21 listed properties within our community (<b>ME17 1QJ, 1QL, 1QR</b>), from Openreach.<br><br>

            This final cost is <b>£40,500.</b> <br><br>

            After seeking further clarification as to why the previous inaccurate quote of £46,747</a> which included 45 properties <i>(half of which were non-existent, plus additional properties at the bottom of Hollingbourne Hill - who can currently receive a fibre based connection)</i>, was not proportionally represented in the updated cost, no meaningful explanation was given. <br><br>

            The UK Government will provide <b>£1,500</b> per residential property and <b>£3,500</b> per business property to help towards the funding of the project. <br><br>

            Whilst KCC had previously offered an additional top up of £3,500 (bringing the total available funding per residential and business property to £5,000 and £7,000 respectively), <b>due to the numerous delays within Openreach’s infrastructure planning department, all of KCC’s available funding has now been allocated to other projects.</b><br><br> 

            Therefore, the likelihood of this £40,500 <b>cost being covered in full</b> via the current government voucher scheme, <b>is now doubtful</b>. <br><br>

            A rough calculation/research shows 18 residential properties and 3 businesses within our postcodes. <br><br>

            This would generate <b>£27,000</b> in residential voucher funding, and <b>£10,500</b> in business voucher funding, totalling <b>£37,500</b>. <br><br>

            Given the deficit of <b>£3,000</b>, split equally between all residential properties and businesses, each would be required to pay <b>£142.86</b> to cover this shortfall.<br><br>

            Whilst some may be willing to help towards this cost, <b>each residential or business property that is unwilling to pay £142.68, will result in an incremental increase of this figure and the deficit as a whole. </b><br>
            
            <hr>
            <b>Regardless if the shortfall could be met collectively,</b> a legal entity must sign a contract with Openreach, in order to proceed with this project.  This could be an established, or newly created entity (either in the form of a business, or a community interest company). The primary reason for this, is due to a particular term of the government’s voucher scheme, which requires all properties (residential or business) that submit a voucher, to contract a fibre service (for a 12 month duration), when available. <br><br>
            
            If a property were to submit a voucher, and were not to contract a fibre service after the infrastructure has been built, <b>this legal entity would be liable for the value of the voucher. </b><br><br>

            Obviously, I doubt anyone responsible for said entity would be willing to sign such a contract. <br><br>

            <b>In addition to this</b>, the deadline for vouchers to be submitted is <b>31st March 2021</b>. This date is when the current government voucher scheme ends.<br>
            <b>Note:</b> Whilst vouchers must be submitted by this date, <b>the contract can be signed after this date.</b>

            <hr>
            <b>A new, replacement government voucher scheme, is due to be announced by the government imminently.</b> The only details that Openreach currently possess regarding this replacement scheme, is that the postcode eligibility has been reduced by approximately 70%. Fortunately, all our postcodes fall within the eligible 30%. <b>However, at present, the value of each voucher within this new scheme is unknown.</b> If the voucher value increases <i>(which may just be ‘wishful thinking’ on my behalf at this point)</i>, <b>the final total may be fully covered, resulting in zero deficit/shortfall, negating the need for additional personal or business funding. </b> <br><br>

            My contact at Openreach, has stated that <b>the best course of action may be to ensure all residents and businesses that would contract a fibre service if available, to submit their voucher application.</b> By doing so, the value of the shortfall could be accurately determined. After submitting your voucher application, the government will then send the voucher to yourself, which will then be required to be submitted to Openreach. <br><br>
            
            <b>At present, these are the steps (in sequential order) that need to be achieved, in order to proceed further with the community fibre project:</b><br><br> 
            <div class="alert alert-success">

                1) All those who would contract a fibre based service (when available), to submit their voucher application (details below).<br><br>
    
                2) This will allow a determination of both the voucher fund total, and the remaining shortfall.<br><br>
    
                3) Compare the value of the vouchers within the new scheme (to determine whether this new total value of vouchers, would result in zero shortfall/deficit).<br><br>
                
                4) Create an entity to sign a contract with Openreach (and collectively pay any deficit/shortfall remaining after all vouchers value has been totaled).
                </div>
            
            <b>In summary: </b><br><br>
            The repeated errors and delays by Openreach ultimately led to the loss in securing KCC funding, would have far exceeded this project's cost <i>(when cost was eventually, accurately, determined by Openreach)</i>. <br><br>

            Had there been little delay, enabling KCC funding to be secured, just 3 businesses and 4 residents submitting their vouchers, would have covered the cost of the project for the whole community. This would have also significantly reduced any possible liability of any legal entity. <br><br>
            
            Whilst there were other infrastructure providers that could have been selected for this project, Openreach were chosen as they would provide the largest variety and choice of internet service providers (who you pay for a internet/fibre service), when completed. This choice would have ensured competitive pricing between ISPs that use the Openreach network, unavailable via independent infrastructure providers.<br><br>

            <div class="alert alert-primary">
                By submitting your voucher application, you’re stating that you would be willing to contract a fibre based service if available.

        <!-- Mar 1st Update -->
      <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-mar1" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-mar1-tab">
        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary bs-callout-xl">
          <h5>Update 1st March</h5>
            I’ve delayed posting any subsequent updates, until today. This is due to the cumbersome, drawn-out processes that have taken place, since the previous, 1st Nov update. <br><br>
            After much delay and constant chasing without reply throughout November, December and January, I finally received a formal reply on the 15th Jan. <br><br>

            Despite stating the reason for the long delay was due to ‘in-depth’ assessment of the local geography, the formal final offer, listed numerous addresses at the bottom of the Hollingbourne Hill (Pilgrims Way, Upper Street - <b>all of which can already receive a fibre connection</b>) which were never included within our original proposal. <br><br>

            In addition, all ME17 1QJ addresses were <b>duplicated</b>.<br><br>

            <b>These errors, gave the total final cost quoted as £46,747.</b> <br><br>

            Obviously, if addresses are duplicated, plus additional properties at the bottom of the hill (who already can contract a fibre service currently, and who were not included in our original proposal) have been incorporated to produce this quote, the quote is wholly inaccurate.<br><br>
            <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-default bs-callout-xl">
                <b>The reason for the duplication: </b><br><br>
                    Openreach showed some of the addresses listed at ME17 1QJ as currently being able to contract a fibre based service currently. The issue, is that none of these addresses actually exist. <br><br>

                    <b>Confused?</b><br><br>

                    Previously, the Openrach wholesale broadband availability checker <i>(the system used by all ISPs that use the Openreach network - to determine which services they can offer/speeds you should be able to achieve)</i>, showed duplicated addresses within the ME17 1QJ (some form of variation added to actual addresses - usually with ‘Cottage’ added somewhere within the 1st line of the address). <br><br>

                    <b>Why?</b><br><br>

                    These duplicate/altered addresses (despite not actually existing) showed as currently being able to contract a fibre service. Whilst the actual, correct addresses, showed as not being able to contract a fibre service. I believe these duplicate address were entered, to show on an Openreach coverage map (shared with local government/local authorities), that our community is already covered by a fibre service - <b>which may be the reason, why zero investment has ever been made within our local area's infrastructure</b>.
            </div>
            

            After numerous phone-calls and emails over the past 6 weeks, as of today, the Openreach wholesale broadband availability checker, has been modified, to accurately show addresses that do actually exist.<br><br>

            Due to these issues (addresses at bottom of hill, duplicate addresses at ME17 1QJ), the latest update I received on <b>Feb 26th:</b><br>
        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-default bs-callout-xl">
            <i>’Your final offer design has been completed and it’s in finance sign off. I can’t see the output yet but it should be available to send to you in the next week to 10 days. I will continue to keep an eye on it and chase when I can.’</i>
    
        </div>

          <h5>Update 1st Nov</h5>
          After chasing Openreach for a response this week (which should have taken 10-15 working days from Sep 21st), they responded this afternoon with the below:<br>
          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-default bs-callout-xl">
            <i>
              I’m sorry there has been a large delay in our response, we’re experiencing an extremely high amount of customer contacts at present which is having an effect on our usual response time.<br><br>
              I can confirm your project is still with our planning team however it has gone straight to final pricing. Normally we’d provide an initial costing for providing fibre broadband to you and your community.  However, upon investigation in to your area, it appears there could be government funding available which could cover the majority or all of the network build costs. This is subject to eligibility and terms and conditions. <br><br>
              Because of this, we can move straight on to the final offer stage. This can take up to 6 weeks and is the next stage in the process. This means we are saving time and have a head start on the process for your community.<br><br>
              In the meantime if you have any questions then please don’t hesitate to contact us.<br>
            </i>

          After submitting the addresses and telephone numbers of those who expressed support of a Hollingbourne Hill cabinet to the Openreach, they responded on 21st Sep with the below:<br>
          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-default bs-callout-xl">

              Thank you for providing the list of addresses you wish to be included in the Community Fibre Project.

              Once these costs have been determined, we can move on to the next stage. Some areas may be eligible for vouchers to part fund a project. Please note, this is not something Openreach have any power over and it is down to the Department of Digital, Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS). The vouchers are based on area and eligibility.<br><br>
              We will keep you informed throughout the process and let you know of any further information we need as we progress.<br>

            Once I receive this from Openreach I will provide an update on here. <br><br>
    
            It has also been brought to my attention by one of the members of our community that we may be eligible for further, additional funding via KCC’s ’Top-Up Voucher’:<br>

        Grants worth <b>£2,500</b> per residential property, and <b>£3,500</b> per business, are available now to improve our internet service.
      </div>

      <p><b>Fellow residents of Hollingbourne Hill and the surrounding postcodes,</b><br><br>
      Properties and businesses listed within the postcodes; <b>ME17 1QJ, ME17 1QL</b> and <b>ME17 1QR</b> all currently receive internet speeds of less than <b>10 Mbps.</b><br><br>
      This is due to the 2.5 - 3.2 km distance between these postcodes and the Hollingbourne exchange located at <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/sjB5RvRW5GMigPfb7">78 Eyhorne Street</a>.<br><br>
      Whilst the majority of the village can receive speeds of up to <b>74 Mbps</b>, everyone located around the top of Hollingbourne Hill and beyond, are unable to achieve anywhere close to those speeds.<br><br>
      Due to the relatively small number of properties at the above postcodes, in addition to their distance from the exchange, previously it has not been commercially viable for Openreach/BT to install a cabinet within our area, to provide an improved internet service. <br><br>
      <b>However</b>, as part of the UK Government’s election pledge to bring broadband speeds of up to <b>1,000 Mbps</b> to the whole country by 2025, rural premises with broadband speeds of less than <b>100 Mbps</b> can use vouchers worth <b>£1,500</b> per home and up to <b>£3,500</b> per business, to support the cost of installing new fast and reliable service. This is via the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rgc-programme-key-information">Government’s Rural Gigabit Connectivity Programme.</a><br><br>
      Kent County Council <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/broadband/broadband-voucher-schemes/kent-broadband-top-up-voucher">will also top up these voucher payments to residential properties by an additional £1,000, </a><b>bringing the total available funding per property to £2,500.</b> <br><br>
      Considering we all receive just <b>10 Mbps</b> or lower, <b>this is our opportunity to improve our internet speed and reliability, as a community.</b> <br><br>
      This is required to support in an increasing number of internet-capable devices in the home, which include: <br><br>
      <b>Mobile Phones</b> - Whatsapp, FaceTime<br>
      <b>Desktop Computer & Laptops</b><br>
      <b>iPads and Tablets</b><br>
      <b>Smart TVs</b> - Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, ITV Player, Now TV, Youtube, BT TV<br><br>
      All of these devices compete for the same limited bandwidth, and basic broadband services with slow speeds is increasingly becoming a major bottleneck. <br><br>
      The recent <b>COVID-19</b> lockdown measures have highlighted this issue further. Keeping in contact with families during these difficult times (often via the internet) was made harder due to sluggish speed and reliability. Equally, businesses in the local area that rely on the internet may have experienced a further obstacle to operate.<br><br>
      Additionally, a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2020/07/62-of-brits-might-not-buy-a-house-without-strong-broadband.html">survey</a> by Internet Service Provider TalkTalk found 62% of British people admit they would consider <b>NOT</b> buying a house if it didn’t have a “strong, reliable internet connection”. Overall 53% of respondents said they consider a “fast, reliable internet connection” a priority when house hunting, which has almost <b>doubled to 93% when answered post COVID-19.</b><br><br>
      As mentioned previously, the cost of installing a local cabinet to serve us all has not been viable due to the cost of installation, which on a UK average basis is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2016/03/bt-reveal-fttc-broadband-cabinet-costs-bduk-confirm-delays.html">£27,500</a>. <i>(It should be noted this is an average across the UK and is dependant on the number of properties, location etc)</i> <br><br>
      Given the grants (£2,500 per home, £3,500 per business) available by both the Government and KCC, this cost <b>may</b> be completely covered. <b>It will however be dependant upon us, as a community, coming together, to demand a faster connection.</b> Pooling all of our grants/vouchers together will increase the chances of a new cabinet being installed locally, providing us all a reliable and fast internet connection.<br>
      <div class="alert alert-danger">
        A final cost will not be given by Openreach/BT until all properties and businesses requesting a faster connection have been accounted for.
      </div>
        In order to receive this quote, <b>each property and business that wishes to benefit from an improvement of speed and reliability of their internet service, needs to provide their address and landline number, which will be passed on to Openreach/BT.</b> By providing your address and telephone number, Openreach/BT can accurately assess the cost, demand, and the total value of all grants. This is a requirement to receive a quote and <b>is in no way an obligation of any form.</b> <br><br>
        Once a quote has been received, and the total amount of Government and KCC funding is totalled, we can, as a community, assess our options going forward. The more properties/businesses that express an interest, the likelihood of the total cost being covered by grants, is increased. <br><br>
